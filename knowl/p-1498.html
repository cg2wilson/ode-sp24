<div class="para">You might want to consider a strategy similar to the following.</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">First examine the case when <span class="process-math">\(a = 0\text{.}\)</span> You should compute the eigenvalues for this case and determine how the behavior of solutions to your system depend on <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span>  Be sure to think about what is happening on the boundary between different regions and specify what is happening to solutions for each case. You may want to draw example phase planes for each of the regions. You should have a clear, accurate, and complete picture of the <span class="process-math">\(bc\)</span>-space in terms of these behaviors.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">You should now do the same analysis for the case <span class="process-math">\(a = 1\)</span> as you did for <span class="process-math">\(a = 0\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Describe the behavior of your system when <span class="process-math">\(0 \lt a \lt 1\)</span> and be specific about what is changing.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Completely describe what behaviors occur when <span class="process-math">\(a = -1\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">You should now use the cases from your previous parts to help make a general picture. You need to draw the three dimensional parameter space showing all of the possible behaviors in the system and identify which regions (in terms of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span>) exhibit which behaviors. Be creative in your display of this information. You may even want ot build a physical model to display your findings.</div></li>
