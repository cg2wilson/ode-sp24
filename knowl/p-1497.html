<div class="para">This project is about classifying all of the possible behaviors for a system of linear differential equations. Consider the family of systems of linear differential equations, <span class="process-math">\(d \mathbf x/dt = A \mathbf x\text{,}\)</span> where</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
A = \begin{pmatrix} a \amp c \\ b \amp a \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The goal of this project is to produce a picture of how the values of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> affect the behavior of solutions to your system of differential equations. This means that you will need to precisely describe each possible region of <span class="process-math">\(abc\)</span>-space and the corresponding types of behaviors in that region (spiral, sink, repeated eigenvalue, etc.). Representing these regions in three dimensional space can be difficult, so start early on this project and be creative in your creations. Your report should address the following questions at a minimum (but you will likely need to explore more than just these questions to fully understand your parameter space).</div>
