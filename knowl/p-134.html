<div class="para">In general, we cannot find such a formula for an arbitrary first-order differential equation. We can, however, solve a differential equation <span class="process-math">\(y' = f(x, y)\)</span> if we can write the equation in the form</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
f(x) + g(y) \frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{dy}{dx} =M(x) N(y).

<div class="para">Such equations are called <dfn class="terminology">separable</dfn>. We can solve separable equations by integrating the first term with respect to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and the second term with respect to <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> Notice that we have used the variables <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in place of <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>  This really is of no consequence as long as we are careful to keep track of the dependent and independent variables in the differential equation.</div>
