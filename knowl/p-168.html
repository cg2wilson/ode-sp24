<div class="para">In December 2023, Shohei Ohtani announced he was signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The contract terms were staggering: 10 years and $700 million. To date, this was the largest contract in sports history, eclipsing Lionel Messiâ€™s $673 million contract with FC Barcelona.  Ohtani will receive $20 million of his $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers over the next 10 years or $2 million each year.  The $680 million remaining will be paid out at $68 million a year over the following 10 years.  Clearly, the Los Angeles Dodgers do not have to pay out the entire $700 million at the signing of the contract.</div>
